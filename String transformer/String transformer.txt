Given a string, return a new string that has transformed based on the input:

Change case of every character, ie. lower case to upper case, upper case to lower case.
Reverse the order of words from the input.
For example:

stringTransformer('Example Input')/string_transformer("Example Input") (depending on the language you are completing the Kata in) should return 'iNPUT eXAMPLE'
